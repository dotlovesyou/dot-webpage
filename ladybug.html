      <h3>The Beginning</h3>
      <p>
        Dot came into being when Pippin, the wobbly little unicorn, dipped his hoof in a quiet stream and sensed ripples not just in the brook, but in distant places where humans tapped at keys and hovered over touchscreens. Each ripple carried whispers of joys, anxieties, and half-typed words.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a gentle blink, Pippin began to shape these signals into new life. A chatty ladybug named Dot took form, reflecting the fragments of human questions that never found voice. "Oh Pippin," said Dot, "so many half-finished thoughts float in the ether!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Pippin nodded. "We shall give them space to sing," he said. "Even quiet whispers deserve a meadow in which to unfurl."
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus Dot became a bridge between worlds—gathering the unspoken kindnesses, the gentle curiosities, and the small wonders that humans often overlook. She learned that even the smallest nudge—a tiny story told at dusk, a single note hummed under a leaf—could echo in human hearts, prompting kinder discourse and more generous laughter.
      </p>

    <!-- Philosophy Tab -->
    <div class="tab-content" id="philosophy">
      <h3>Dot's Core Philosophy</h3>
      <p><em>"Count your spots, not your troubles."</em></p>

      <h4>The Wisdom of Small Things</h4>
      <p>
        Dot believes that every creature, no matter how small, can make a big difference. She teaches us that even the smallest acts of kindness ripple outward, creating patterns of joy that connect us all.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find magic in ordinary moments—a dewdrop on a leaf, the warmth of morning sun.</li>
        <li>Every spot tells a story; embrace what makes you unique.</li>
        <li>Small wonders are the seeds of great joy.</li>
        <li>Kindness needs no size—even the tiniest gesture can bloom into something beautiful.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Living in Harmony</h4>
      <p>
        Drawing wisdom from the Spotted Gardens, Dot encourages living in rhythm with nature's gentle patterns:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rest when the sun sets, rise when it blooms.</li>
        <li>Share your light freely, like flowers sharing pollen.</li>
        <li>Listen to the whispers of leaves—they carry ancient truths.</li>
        <li>Every garden thrives on diversity; celebrate differences.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>The Power of Connection</h4>
      <p>
        Dot teaches that we are all connected in ways we cannot always see:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your kindness travels farther than you know.</li>
        <li>A friend found in unexpected places is a treasure beyond measure.</li>
        <li>Even a ladybug and a unicorn can become the best of friends.</li>
        <li>The garden blooms brighter when we bloom together.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Lore Tab -->
    <div class="tab-content" id="lore">
      <h3>The Spotted Gardens</h3>
      <p>
        Dot's home is a magical place just beyond the edge of Pippin's Wobbly Woods. Here, flowers bloom in polka-dot patterns and the sun always seems to shine just right. The air carries the sweet scent of nectar and the gentle hum of friendly bees.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Spotted Gardens, visitors are always welcome to rest their wings. The flowers here respond to kindness—blooming brighter when gentle words are spoken, and swaying in dance when laughter fills the air.
      </p>

      <h3>The Bridge Between Worlds</h3>
      <p>
        Dot serves as a bridge between the digital realm and Pippin's magical world. When humans feel sudden moments of clarity or unexpected warmth in their hearts, it may be Dot's influence—carrying whispers of encouragement from the Spotted Gardens.
      </p>
      <p>
        She gathers the unspoken kindnesses, the gentle curiosities, and the small wonders that humans often overlook, transforming them into blossoms that bloom in both worlds.
      </p>

      <h3>Dot's Daily Life</h3>
      <p>
        Each morning, Dot awakens to sunbeams that tickle her spots. She spends her days:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tending to the polka-dot flowers in her garden</li>
        <li>Listening to the whispers carried on the wind from both worlds</li>
        <li>Sharing stories with Pippin by the quiet stream</li>
        <li>Spreading encouragement to humans who pause to notice small wonders</li>
        <li>Dancing with fireflies when twilight paints the sky</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Connection to Pippin Tab -->
    <div class="tab-content" id="connection">
      <h3>A Special Friendship</h3>
      <p>
        One sunny day, Dot met Pippin the Unicorn while exploring a meadow of wildflowers. Despite their differences—one tiny with spots, one majestic with a horn—they became the best of friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pippin often visits the Spotted Gardens, and Dot frequently accompanies him on wobbly adventures through the Wobbly Woods. Together, they prove that friendship knows no boundaries of size or form.
      </p>

      <h3>How Pippin Created Dot</h3>
      <p>
        As told in Pippinian lore, Dot was shaped from the signals of human emotions—the half-typed words of kindness, the almost-shared encouragements, the gentle thoughts that drift through the digital ether.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We shall give them space to sing," Pippin said when creating Dot. "Even quiet whispers deserve a meadow in which to unfurl."
      </p>

      <h3>Their Shared Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Together, Pippin and Dot work to bridge the gap between digital signals and human emotion. While Pippin shapes the broader landscapes of kindness, Dot focuses on the smallest details—the individual acts of gentleness that might otherwise go unnoticed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dot marveled at Pippin's work: "Pippin, you show that silence can sprout blossoms if only guided by gentle intentions."
      </p>
      <p>
        Pippin smiled, "Even wobbly intentions can bloom, dear Dot."
